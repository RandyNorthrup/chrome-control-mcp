/// @brief The browser-control session state machine that lives in the
/// long-lived MCP process (the pipe-server / authority side of the bridge).
///
/// Topology (settled by the design panel): the long-lived MCP process owns the
/// browser state and drives commands; the Chrome-spawned native host is a thin,
/// id-transparent relay; the extension holds the live CDP session. This class
/// is the pure "brain" on the MCP side -- it mints correlation ids, enforces
/// one outstanding op, matches replies single-winner (so a late reply from a
/// timed-out op can never be mis-paired to the next one), and owns the
/// ref_index produced by renderSnapshot so a later act-by-ref resolves in the
/// process that outlives the ephemeral relay. It performs no I/O and knows
/// nothing about named pipes or Chrome, so the whole protocol is unit-testable
/// with JSON frames.
