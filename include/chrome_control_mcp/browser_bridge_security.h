/// @file browser_bridge_security.h
/// @brief Security + discovery primitives for the browser-control bridge pipe.
///
/// The bridge pipe carries LLM-driven browser commands and web-page-derived
/// replies between the long-lived MCP process (server) and the Chrome-spawned
/// relay (client). The design panels made the pipe DACL the load-bearing
/// control, so these are kept in one small, separately-reviewed unit. Unlike
/// the app's elevated-helper pipe (which grants BUILTIN\Users and sets no
/// integrity label), the bridge pipe is scoped to the CURRENT USER's SID only
/// and floored at Medium integrity, so a lower-integrity process (a compromised
/// browser renderer -- the real injection-to-local-escalation vector) cannot
/// open it.
///
/// Honest boundary: a same-user, same-integrity process is INSIDE this boundary
/// (it can read the rendezvous record, OpenProcess our processes, or drive
/// Chrome's own debugging directly). These primitives enforce the OS boundaries
/// that DO exist (other users, other sessions, lower integrity, remote) and
/// fail closed on squatting; the real control against a hostile page is the
/// downstream confirmation gate, not this pipe.
namespace chrome_control_mcp {

/// The rendezvous record the server publishes and the relay reads to find +
/// greet the server (the Chrome-launched relay cannot receive the pipe name on
/// argv).
