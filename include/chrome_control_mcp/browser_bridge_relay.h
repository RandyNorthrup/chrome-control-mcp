/// @file browser_bridge_relay.h
/// @brief The browser-control bridge RELAY, hosted in the Chrome-spawned native
/// messaging process (the client end of the bridge pipe).
///
/// Topology (settled by the design panel): the long-lived MCP process owns the
/// browser authority (BrowserBridgeSession + BrowserBridgePipeServer); THIS process
/// is a thin, id-transparent relay. Chrome launches it as a native messaging host,
/// so it cannot receive the pipe name on argv -- it discovers the server through the
/// rendezvous record, connects to the hardened pipe as an IDENTIFICATION-level client,
/// verifies the SERVER by code identity (the record's pid must resolve to our own
/// executable, so a squatted record cannot redirect us to a foreign process), and
/// completes the token/protocol handshake. Thereafter it pumps whole native-messaging
/// frames between Chrome's stdio and the pipe with no parsing or correlation: a command
/// from the server goes to the extension over stdout, and the extension's reply comes
/// back over stdin to the server. All correlation, id minting, and ref_index state live
/// in the MCP process, so the relay can die and be relaunched by Chrome at any time
/// without losing browser state.
///
/// This phase is strictly request/reply (the extension speaks only in response to a
/// forwarded command), which is why a single-threaded alternating pump is correct and
/// matches the server's one-op-outstanding read-after-write model. An event channel
/// (for unsolicited detach/navigation notices) is a later unit.
namespace chrome_control_mcp {

/// Read one whole native-messaging frame (a JSON object) from the browser side, or
/// return false at end-of-stream / on a framing error. Injected so the pump is
/// testable without real stdio.

/// rendezvous_path: read the record, verify the recorded pid resolves to OUR OWN
/// executable image (fail closed on a foreign or missing process, so a rewritten
/// record cannot redirect the relay), then open the pipe as an IDENTIFICATION-level
/// client. On success returns a valid handle and fills @p token_out / @p protocol_out
/// for the handshake; on failure returns INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE with @p error set. The
/// caller owns the returned handle and must CloseHandle it.
