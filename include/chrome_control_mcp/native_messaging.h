/// @brief Chrome Native Messaging wire framing for the browser-control bridge.
///
/// Chrome talks to a native messaging host over the host's stdio using a simple
/// framing: each message is a 32-bit length in NATIVE byte order (little-endian
/// on the x86/x64 Windows targets) followed by that many bytes of UTF-8 JSON.
/// This is a different framing from the newline-delimited MCP JSON-RPC the same
/// executable speaks to the app; keeping the codec here, pure and header-light,
/// lets it be unit-tested with byte buffers and reused by the host loop.
namespace chrome_control_mcp {

/// Hard upper bound on a single decoded frame. Chrome caps host->browser
/// messages at 1 MiB, but browser->host messages (which may later carry a
/// screenshot) can be far larger, so the decoder guard is generous; it exists
/// only to stop a corrupt or hostile length prefix from triggering a
/// multi-gigabyte allocation.
inline constexpr int kMaxNativeMessageBytes = 64 * 1024 * 1024;

/// Chrome's hard limit on a single host->browser message. A native host that
/// emits a frame larger than this is terminated by Chrome, so the Chrome-facing
/// writer must refuse an oversized frame rather than let the whole bridge be
/// killed.
inline constexpr int kMaxHostToBrowserBytes = 1024 * 1024;

/// Version of the browser-control bridge protocol spoken over native messaging.
/// Bump when the message shapes change so both ends can detect a mismatch.
inline constexpr int kBrowserBridgeProtocol = 1;

/// One attempt to decode a frame from the front of a byte buffer.
struct NativeFrame {
  enum class Status {
    Ok,       ///< A complete, valid frame was decoded into `message`.
    NeedMore, ///< The buffer does not yet hold a full frame; read more bytes.

/// the buffer is short of a full frame (caller reads more and retries), Error
