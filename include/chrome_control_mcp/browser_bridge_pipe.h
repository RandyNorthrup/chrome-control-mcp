/// @brief The browser-control bridge pipe SERVER, hosted in the long-lived MCP
/// process (the authority end).
///
/// It owns the hardened named pipe (see browser_bridge_security), publishes the
/// rendezvous record, and runs one dedicated I/O thread that: waits for the
/// Chrome-spawned relay to connect, verifies the peer by code identity (the
/// client must be our own executable and, in production, launched by Chrome),
/// completes a token/protocol handshake, then serves exactly one browser
/// command at a time from the MCP thread over overlapped, deadline-bounded
/// reads/writes. All pipe-handle I/O lives on that single thread, so there are
/// no cross-thread handle races; the MCP thread hands a command frame across
/// and waits for the reply.
///
/// The server is deliberately decoupled from BrowserBridgeSession: it exposes a
/// monotonically increasing connection generation instead of calling the
/// (single- threaded) session directly, so the MCP dispatch can observe a fresh
/// relay and drive onHostConnected/onHostDisconnected on its own thread.
