# Register (or remove) the Chrome Control MCP browser-control native messaging host for
# Chrome on the current user. Chrome launches the host named here whenever the
# extension calls chrome.runtime.connectNative("com.chromecontrolmcp.browser").
#
# Usage:
#   ./register_native_host.ps1 [-ExtensionId <id>] [-ExePath <path-to-chrome_control_mcp.exe>]
#   ./register_native_host.ps1 -Unregister
#
# ExtensionId defaults to the pinned project id; pass it only for an unpacked
# build with different public manifest identity, in which case the id is shown on chrome://extensions
# after you load the unpacked extension from browser/extension. ExePath defaults to
# the built Debug binary beside this repo; pass it explicitly for a Release/installed
# build.
