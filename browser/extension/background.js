// Chrome Control MCP -- background service worker.
//
// Unit 6 scope: the DOM READ path. The extension connects to the native host over
// Chrome native messaging (the chrome_control_mcp relay), waits for the bridge to come up,
// then answers command frames forwarded from the Chrome Control MCP assistant:
//   - snapshot  : attach the DevTools protocol to the active tab and build the filtered
//                 DOM capture the model reads (roles/names from the accessibility tree,
//                 geometry from a DOM snapshot, joined by backendNodeId).
//   - read      : return the active tab's text or html.
//   - navigate / back / forward / reload : drive history via chrome.tabs.
//   - listTabs / selectTab / newTab / closeTab : tab management via chrome.tabs.
//   - click / type / pressKey / scroll : input injected over CDP Input (unit 7).
//   - screenshot : a PNG of the active tab via CDP Page.captureScreenshot (unit 8).
//   - clickAt : coordinate click at screenshot pixels, dpr-converted to CSS px (unit 9).
//   - dialog : arm the next JS dialog's response + report the last one (unit 10); dialogs
//              are auto-answered by an onEvent handler so the page never wedges.
//
// PROTOCOL: the native host is a thin relay in strict request/reply. For every
// {type:"command", id, cmd, ...} frame this worker replies EXACTLY ONCE with
// {type:"result", id, cmd, payload} or {type:"error", id, cmd, error}. It NEVER sends
// an unsolicited frame (that would desync the relay's one-op pump). The relay's own
// {type:"bridge_ready"|"bridge_unavailable"} frames are informational. A {type:"cancel"} frame
// retires whatever command is in flight -- the polling handlers stop and that command answers
// with its own error -- and is itself never replied to, so the pump stays in step.
//
// SECURITY: page content is untrusted DATA. The worker never eval()s page-controlled
// strings, never lets a page decide what is permitted, and only navigates to http(s).
// The real control against a hostile page is the assistant-side confirmation gate.
